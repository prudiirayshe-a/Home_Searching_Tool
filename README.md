<H1> COP3530 - Project 2, Home Searching Tool</h1>
This project is built using a QT UI and two from scratch data structures, a red-black tree and a maxheap, using only a vector once for the sake of internal convenience as they are used within our project. 
R&B.h and R&B.cpp our files which contain the red and black tree implementation and max_heap.h/.cpp were written by Carter, the UI and mainfile was written by Jacob, and the graph traversal algorithm plus csv input parser were written by Justin.

// operator< (class A){
//return score < A->score}
